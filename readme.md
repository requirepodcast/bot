# Require Podcast Discord Bot

## Development

1. Be sure to have Docker and docker-compose installed on your machine
2. Create a Discord bot via [developer dashboard](https://discord.com/developers)
3. Put required variables in .env.dev file (discord bot token, etc.)
4. `npm run dev` to start up docker-compose - database will be automatically turned on, as docker-compose has a development instance set up.
